# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This study guide was created to help those who are new to web development learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Having all of the most important notes in one place is one of the most useful tools a newcomer can have when learning a new skill, so I have laid out all of the notes that I've come up with along my own journey to learning these coding languages in one easy to read webpage. 

The site is not only a tool that can be used by other new coders, but was also a great opportunity for me to test new coding skills and refresh my memory on some of the basics I'd previously studied. It gave me a "safe" sandbox to work in while I tinkered with HTML and CSS code I discovered along the way. The result is a site that will be a helpful, living resource for me to use throughout my start in coding.

I had quite a bit of fun learning CSS and playing around with the design of the page, so don't be alarmed if the look changes from time to time. It just means I'm continuing to explore CSS in my sandbox and playing with the look and feel of the site.

## Usage

The guide is structured around the four topics I've covered so far in my web development studies: the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding langauges, and GitHub/GitBash (Git). Each topic has a separate card with all of my key notes.

"Open the Console to See What's Happening," appears at the top of the screen, referring to Google Chrome's developer tools. If you open the console tab within developer tools, you will see a prompt titled "Which topic should we study first?" This promp uses JavaScript to pull a covered topic at random (see the final line of the console tab) and encourage you to study that during this visit to the study guide. Following this randomized prompt, rather than always studying the topics you like best or are most comfortable with, will help ensure you maintain a well-rounded knowledge of all of the web development basics.
